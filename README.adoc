== Json Feed Aggregator

Developed using Jdk 1.8, Spring Boot and embedded MongoDb. 

Available endpoints:

[/news]
====
`GET` Return all the news from the remote resources.
==== 
[/news/{source}]
====
`GET` Return all the news from the remote resources filtered by `{source}`.
Avaiable sources are:
	- Hacker;
	- NyTimes;
	- Bbc.
	 
==== 
[/save]
====
`GET` Store the news feed into MongoDb.
==== 
[/list]
====
`GET` Retrieve the news feed from MongoDb.
==== 

[NOTE]
====
For now you must also set the `eureka.instance.*` properties shown here so that the "hello world" service's URL will be correct in the Eureka registration. This requirement should go away in future versions of the Spring Cloud Pivotal connector.
